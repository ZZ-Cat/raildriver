                Notes from @ZZ-Cat on Scanning the Version Files for Updates:

                How exactly am I going to go about this?
                With the local Version File, I am scanning through the file & comparing the
                checksums of each file to the checksums that are in the local Version File.
                That is how I am determining if a file needs to be updated or not.

                With the online Version File, it is a little bit different.
                This is because I need to somehow compare the semantic version numbers of each
                library (including RailDriver's main file) to the semantic version numbers in the
                local Version File.
                This becomes more complicated when I need to compare the checksums of each file
                in the online Version File to the checksums in the local Version File.

                I have two ways that I can accomplish this.
                The first way is to compare the checksums first & then compare the semantic
                version numbers.
                The second way is to compare the semantic version numbers first & then compare
                the checksums.

                In the first way, I can easily use the checksums & the semantic version numbers
                to catch any errors. For example, if the checksums don't match, then I know that
                the file has been modified. Then, I can compare the semantic version numbers to
                see if the file needs to be updated. If the semantic version numbers in the local
                Version File are greater than the semantic version numbers in the online Version
                File, then I can check if the player is a developer. If the player is not a developer,
                then I can throw an error. If the player is a developer, I may want to throw a warning
                to remind the developer to update the online Version File on GitHub.
                Then, if the semantic version numbers in the local Version File are less than the
                semantic version numbers in the online Version File, then one or more of RailDriver's
                files need to be updated.
                If the semantic version numbers in the local Version File are equal to the semantic
                version numbers in the online Version File, then the file does not need to be updated.
                
                Additionally, I will not throw any errors or warnings here, regardless of whether or
                not the player is a developer. This is because the player may have modified one or
                more of RailDriver's files, to tune the script to their liking. In this case, the
                semantic version numbers in the local Version File must remain unchanged. This is
                to maintain the integrity of the local Version File, because it also contains the
                license, attribution, & other vital information about RailDriver; which is important
                for the player to keep intact. If the player modifies the semantic version numbers
                in the local Version File, then not only are they corrupting the local Version File,
                they are also violating the license & attribution requirements.

                In the case where the player is a developer (such as yours truly), seeing errors
                or warnings here is annoying.
                This is because I am constantly working on RailDriver both on my local machine &
                on GitHub. This means that I am constantly updating the online Version File on
                GitHub, but I am not always updating the local Version File on my local machine.
                I have automated this process as much as I can, but it is still annoying to see
                errors & warnings here, when I know that I am working on RailDriver.

                In the second way, I need to parse the semantic version numbers of both the local
                Version File & the online Version File before I can compare the checksums.
                Then, I can compare the checksums to see if the file needs to be updated.
                Doing it this way adds more computational overhead to RailDriver, due to the fact
                that the semantic version numbers are being parsed on every file in both the local
                Version File & the online Version File.
                Another downside to this method is that I cannot catch errors quite so easily.
                Or, even if I can, this will add to the computational overhead brought on by parsing
                the semantic version numbers. If I am not careful, this can cause 'Tick Quota Exceeded'
                errors to occur, & RailDriver will crash.

                I have reason to believe that the first way is the better way to go about this,
                because it is more efficient & it is a more reliable way to catch errors.
                However, right now, I am undecided on which way I need to go about this.

                I will need to do some testing to see which way is better.
                I will create another branch off of this branch to test the first way.
                Then, I will create another branch off of this branch to test the second way.
                Each branch will be named 'Version-File-Scanning-Method-1' & 'Version-File-Scanning-Method-2',
                respectively. They will also have slightly different semantic version numbers, so that
                I can test the update process independently of the other branch.
                Both branches will have their own respective Pull Requests on GitHub, & I will merge
                the branch that I conclude is the better method into this branch.

                This does mean that Version 1.0.0-RC1 will be delayed. However, I have no set date for
                the release of Version 1.0.0-RC1, so this is not a big deal.
                With that being said, I will resume working on Version 1.0.0-RC1 after I have finished
                testing the two different methods of scanning the Version Files for updates.

                This branch is the last branch that I will be working on before I release Version 1.0.0-RC1,
                & I will not be working on any other branches until I have finished testing the two
                different methods of scanning the Version Files for updates.
